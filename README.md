# Singly-Linked-Lists

This is the very basic stage of Linked lists. Linked lists is a very attractive and efficient method of saving and accessing data. ``Node`` is the main components in a linked list. In a singly linked list, there are only two properties inside a Node. Those are index or element(``data``) and the reference (``link``). Indexes carries the data added in to a list while the reference holds the address or the link to the next immediate data element. The differences between arrays and the linked list are, linked list can be dynamically expandable and holds links while arrays are fixed length and less flexible. Even the linked list are having more flexibility it consumes more memory compared to an array.


## About the source

This source is just to understand linked lists. I have used gcc version 6.3.0 c++14 compiler but this program can be compiled and run in any lower versions for sure. 


You can use below command to compile the source in both Ubuntu and Windows environments.

g++ SinglyLinkedList.cpp -o sll.exe


To run the executable

in Ubuntu  - ./sll.exe then Enter
in Windows - sll.exe then Enter
